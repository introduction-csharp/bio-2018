# BIO 2018

This [paper from 2018](https://olympiad.org.uk/papers/2018/bio/round_one.html) is a classic of the genre. 

## Question 1 - short and sharp 

As normal, Q1 is very approachable, but be sure to read the question carefully (i.e. "When calculating percentages the amount is *rounded up* to 2 decimal places. E.g. 10.201 and 10.207 would both be rounded up to 10.21."). 

## Question 2 - all about the setup 

Q2 is the normal grunt work, but again, very doable. 

## Question 3 - huge number of possibilities 

Q3 is a traditional for its type, can you avoid the need to brute force?
